  - "INTERVIEW RECORDING - DR. TAYLOR GREENE PART 6\\n[BEGIN LOG: 11:00 AM]\\n\\nDr.
    Greene: \u201CSo\u2026 do you remember exactly\u2026 sorry, I can\u2019t even
    read what I\u2026 Tell me\u2026 tell me one more time, did anyone give you the
    pen? Did anyone give you the pen?\u201D\\n\\nThe subject is silent.\\n\\nThe
    door to the room opens, and a few sets of footsteps walk in. Dr. Greene continues
    coughing, and after a few seconds, a guttural sound begins to come from her throat,
    something between retching and screaming, and Dr. Greene falls to the floor."
  - "The subject is silent.\\n\\nSomething begins to work its way up through Dr.
    Greene, something heavy and wet that comes from her stomach and pinches her throat.
    Dr. Greene grabs onto the wall and falls. The footsteps in the room are now panicked
    and erratic. Now, Dr. Greene begins to scream.\\n\\nThere is the sound of something
    ancient and deadly in her scream, a banshee\u2019s wail, and Dr. Greene no longer
    sounds like a human. There are more screams from those watching, but the subject
    remains silent. And Dr. Greene now lurches out of the room and into the hallway,
    but it is not footsteps she makes but an unearthly slimy squelching, as if she
    is melting into nothing."
