  - "INTERVIEW RECORDING - DR. TAYLOR GREENE PART 4\\n[BEGIN LOG: 10:29 AM]\\n\\nDr.
    Greene: \u201CAnd, if I gave you a pen, would you be able to write it down?\u201D\\n\\nThe
    subject is silent.\\n\\nDr. Greene lets out a small cough and clears her throat
    again.\\n\\nDr. Greene: \u201CThat\u2019s quite alright. Actually, about a pen:
    that pen in your hands isn\u2019t like any pen I\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s
    quite\u2026 pretty, though. Is that pen important to you?\u201D\\n\\nThe subject
    is silent."
  - "Dr. Greene adjusts her chair and there is the sound of her writing, much slower
    this time. She stops.\\n\\nDr. Greene: \u201CI see. And, was the pen given to
    you by anyone?\u201D\\n\\nThe subject remains silent.\\n\\nThere is the sound
    of the door opening and footsteps. Dr. Greene says a thank you quietly, and the
    door closes. "
