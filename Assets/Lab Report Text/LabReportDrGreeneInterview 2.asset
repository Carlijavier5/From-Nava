  - "INTERVIEW RECORDING - DR. TAYLOR GREENE PART 2\\n[BEGIN LOG: 10:19 AM]\\n\\nDr.
    Greene: \u201CFirst, I want you to know that all of us here at Nava Labs want
    to help you as best we can. We all want you to be safe, and we all want you to
    be as comfortable and as happy as possible. So, if you would like anything at
    all, or if you really just don\u2019t want to talk right now, don\u2019t be afraid
    to ask. Does that sound okay?\u201D\\n\\nThe subject is silent, but there is
    the sound of shuffling feet, and Dr. Greene quickly writes something down on
    her clipboard.\\n\\nDr. Greene: \u201CThank you. Would you be alright with talking
    with me for a little bit? You won\u2019t need to speak if you aren\u2019t comfortable.\u201D\\n\\nThe
    subject remains silent. "
